This is a javascript project realized for the odin's project curriculum.

It's a simple to-do app, to which I will eventually go back and add functionalities as I acquire more skills in js and node js. 

For now, it will simply allow the user to : 
    - Create todo notes with dates, priority, description and a title.
    - Delete those todo or edit them
    - Organize tose to-do tasks by putting them into projects
    - Create/delete those projects
    - Reassign a todo task from one project to another.

User data will be stored in the local storage, but eventually I will switch to a database, and will add a user creation/connexion module so that the user can see his todos from anywhere and on multiple devices.
